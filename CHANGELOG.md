# Changelog

All notable Kallisti changes are documented here.

## [0.2.0-build.49] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Native `MEDIA:` path conversion to authenticated inline-image Markdown.
- Restricted `/v1/native/media` connector endpoint for agent-generated images.
- Native image upload staging through `image.attach_bytes` before prompt submission.
- Regression coverage for inline media, image staging, fast acknowledgments, stalled streams, and pre-ack placeholder ownership.

### Fixed

- Follow-up messages no longer wait behind a stream that ended after acknowledgment without a terminal event.
- Pre-ack transcript polling no longer removes or duplicates the active thinking placeholder.
- Accepted outbox jobs settle through deadline-aware recovery and release the per-conversation FIFO lease.
- Native gateway responses arriving during WebSocket send registration are no longer dropped.
- Public media URLs use the configured HTTPS gateway host instead of an unreachable private connector port.
- Authenticated image requests attach credentials for `/v1/native/` routes without leaking them to arbitrary image hosts.
- Connector media downloads accept validated gateway cookie sessions, native bearer tokens, and persisted paired-device tokens.
- Connector restarts rehydrate paired-device tokens and preserve native-watch refresh credentials.
- Push registration and Live Activity cleanup no longer block chat startup or leave stale activity state.

### Security

- Media serving is limited to configured Hermes image/media roots.
- Unsupported file types, traversal attempts, missing files, and files larger than 10 MB are rejected.
- Gateway cookie and bearer validation is delegated to the gateway's authenticated identity endpoint.
- Public source and documentation were scrubbed of personal names, user-specific paths, private host addresses, device identifiers, captured production logs, and signing credentials.

## [0.2.0-build.41] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- One-time Kallisti pairing-code sign-in for native gateway mode.
- Direct native WebSocket transport for chat, session history, model selection, and profile selection.
- Gateway status, logs, restart operations, push notifications, and Live Activities.

### Fixed

- WebSocket send timeouts and response-registration races.
- Session identity and reconnect handling.
- Model and profile selection against the active session.
- Native basic-auth and pairing-cookie login flows.
- Gateway ticket refresh and session creation timeouts.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Initial Kallisti branding and iOS application structure.
- Connector, relay, widget, watch, intents, and notification-extension targets.

### Attribution

- Built from the earlier Herald mobile client foundation under the repository's MIT license history.
